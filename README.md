# My Travels

## Introduction
My Travels is a Ruby on Rails blog-style website where I document my personal experiences and lesser-known spots from my journeys across Japan, Korea, and Singapore. This platform is crafted to share unique perspectives that may not be highlighted in mainstream travel guides.

## Technologies Used
- **Ruby on Rails**: The core framework driving the application.
- **HTML**: Used to structure the content on the web pages.
- **SCSS**: Enhances the styling of the application.

- **Personal Blog**: Each post reflects personal insights and preferences about different places.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the site is accessible on various devices, enhancing user experience.
